**Tegon Actions** is a powerful framework designed to automate repetitive tasks in issue tracking, streamlining your workflow. 
Whether it’s automatically labeling issues or creating sub-issues for PR reviews, Tegon Actions helps you eliminate manual processes.

But Tegon Actions doesn’t just stop at basic workflows—it integrates seamlessly with other tools you use in issue tracking.

As seen in the image above, actions are initiated based on triggers. A trigger can either be a Tegon event or an event from an external integration you've connected. Examples of triggers include:
1. An **emoji reaction** to a message in Slack.
2. A **message** posted in a Discord channel.
3. An **issue** created in GitHub.
4. A **comment** added to a Tegon issue.

When an event occurs, a Tegon Action is called—this is a piece of TypeScript code that processes the event. 
There are several pre-built actions that you can install, but you're also free to customize or create new actions and deploy them on the platform. 
To simplify this process, we provide a CLI that guides you from action creation to deployment.
